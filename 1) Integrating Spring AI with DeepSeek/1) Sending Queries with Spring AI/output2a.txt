Answer: Alright, let's tackle the problem: **How many times does the letter 'r' appear in the word 'strawberry'?**

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
First, I need to determine how many times the letter 'r' (both uppercase and lowercase, but since the word is in lowercase, we'll consider 'r') appears in the word "strawberry." This means I'll go through each letter of the word one by one and count every instance where the letter is 'r'.

### Step 2: Writing Down the Word
Let's write down the word and label each letter with its position to keep track:

1. s
2. t
3. r
4. a
5. w
6. b
7. e
8. r
9. r
10. y

Wait a minute, let me double-check the spelling of "strawberry" to ensure I've got it right. 

The correct spelling is S-T-R-A-W-B-E-R-R-Y, which indeed has 10 letters as I've listed above. Sometimes, words can be tricky with their spellings, but "strawberry" is spelled with two 'r's towards the end.

### Step 3: Counting the 'r's
Now, let's go through each letter:

1. s - not 'r'
2. t - not 'r'
3. r - yes, that's 1
4. a - not 'r'
5. w - not 'r'
6. b - not 'r'
7. e - not 'r'
8. r - yes, that's 2
9. r - yes, that's 3
10. y - not 'r'

Hmm, according to this, there are three 'r's in "strawberry". But let me read the word again to confirm: s-t-r-a-w-b-e-r-r-y.

- The third letter is 'r' (1)
- The eighth letter is 'r' (2)
- The ninth letter is 'r' (3)

That seems correct. But I have a feeling that "strawberry" might not have three 'r's. Maybe I'm miscounting. Let me try writing it out without numbers:

s t r a w b e r r y

Now, let's pick out the 'r's:

- The 'r' after 't' (1)
- The first 'r' before the 'y' (2)
- The second 'r' right before 'y' (3)

Yes, that's three 'r's.

### Step 4: Verifying the Count
Wait a second, is "strawberry" spelled with three 'r's? I think I might be confusing it with how it's pronounced. Sometimes letters are silent or combined in pronunciation. 

Let me think about similar words or recall how it's spelled. 

"Straw" has 's-t-r-a-w', so one 'r' there.
Then "berry" is 'b-e-r-r-y', which has two 'r's.
Combined, that's 'strawberry' with 'r' from "straw" and two from "berry", totaling three 'r's.

But when I think of the pronunciation, it's "straw-berry," and the 'r's are:

- 'straw' has one 'r' sound
- 'berry' has two 'r's in spelling but in pronunciation, it might sound like one 'r' sound, but in spelling, it's two.

So spelling-wise, it's three 'r's.

### Step 5: Cross-Checking
To be absolutely sure, let me write it out and highlight the 'r's:

s t **r** a w b e **r r** y

Yes, the 'r's are in positions 3, 8, and 9.

### Step 6: Conclusion
After carefully going through each letter and verifying the spelling, I conclude that the letter 'r' appears **three times** in the word "strawberry."

### Final Answer
The letter 'r' appears **three times** in the word "strawberry."
