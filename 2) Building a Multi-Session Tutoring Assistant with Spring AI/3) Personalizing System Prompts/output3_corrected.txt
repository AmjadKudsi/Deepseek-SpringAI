[Explainer] Q: What is photosynthesis?
[Explainer] A: **Direct Definition:**  
Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose (food) and oxygen.  

**How It Works:**  
1. **Light Absorption:** Chlorophyll in plant cells captures sunlight.  
2. **Chemical Reactions:** Light energy splits water molecules (releasing oxygen) and combines CO₂ to form glucose.  
3. **Outputs:** Glucose fuels the plant, and oxygen is released into the air.  

**Key Takeaways:**  
- Occurs in chloroplasts (plant cell organelles).  
- Vital for life on Earth—produces oxygen and forms the base of the food chain.  

**Quick Check:**  
- Why is chlorophyll essential for photosynthesis?  

*(Answer: Chlorophyll absorbs the sunlight needed to power the process.)*
