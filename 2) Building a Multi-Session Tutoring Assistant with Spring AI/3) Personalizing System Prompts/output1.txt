Assistant: Absolutely! I'd love to help you understand the **Pythagorean Theorem**. Let's break it down step by step.

---

### **What is the Pythagorean Theorem?**
The Pythagorean Theorem is a fundamental principle in geometry that relates the sides of a **right-angled triangle**. 

> **Theorem Statement:**  
> *In a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (called legs).*  

Mathematically, it's written as:  
\[
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\]  
where:
- \( a \) and \( b \) are the **legs** of the triangle.
- \( c \) is the **hypotenuse** (the longest side).

---

### **Why Does It Work?**
The theorem works because of the relationship between the areas of squares built on each side of the triangle.

1. Imagine a right triangle with legs \( a \) and \( b \).
2. If you draw squares on each side, the area of the squares will be:
   - \( a^2 \) (on side \( a \))
   - \( b^2 \) (on side \( b \))
   - \( c^2 \) (on the hypotenuse \( c \))
3. The theorem says that the area of the largest square (\( c^2 \)) equals the sum of the areas of the two smaller squares (\( a^2 + b^2 \)).

---

### **Example Problem**
Let’s say we have a right triangle where:
- Leg \( a = 3 \) units
- Leg \( b = 4 \) units  
We want to find the hypotenuse \( c \).

**Step 1:** Plug the values into the formula:  
\[
3^2 + 4^2 = c^2
\]

**Step 2:** Calculate the squares:  
\[
9 + 16 = c^2
\]

**Step 3:** Add them together:  
\[
25 = c^2
\]

**Step 4:** Take the square root of both sides to find \( c \):  
\[
c = \sqrt{25} = 5
\]

**Answer:** The hypotenuse is **5 units**.

---

### **When Is It Used?**
The Pythagorean Theorem is used whenever you have a right triangle and know two sides but need the third. Examples include:
- Finding distances between points in coordinate geometry.
- Checking if a triangle is right-angled.
- Solving real-world problems like ladder lengths or navigation.

---

### **Try It Yourself!**
Here’s a quick problem for you to solve:  

*A right triangle has legs of 5 and 12. What is the length of the hypotenuse?*  

**Answer:**  
\[
5^2 + 12^2 = c^2 \\
25 + 144 = c^2 \\
169 = c^2 \\
c = \sqrt{169} = \boxed{13}
\]

---

### **Key Takeaways**
1. **Only works for right triangles** (must have a 90° angle).
2. The hypotenuse is **always the longest side**.
3. Useful for solving missing lengths in geometry and applied problems.
