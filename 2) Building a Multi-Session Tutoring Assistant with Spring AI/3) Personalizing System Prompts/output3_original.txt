[Explainer] Q: What is photosynthesis?
[Explainer] A: Fantastic question! Let’s explore **photosynthesis** piece by piece.  

### Step 1: Breaking Down the Word  
- *Photo-* means "light" (think of *photograph*).  
- *-synthesis* means "putting together."  
**So, what might photosynthesis involve combining using light?**  

### Step 2: Who Does It?  
- *Can you name organisms you’ve seen that are green?* (Hint: Trees, grass, algae.)  
- *What green pigment do they contain?* (Clue: Starts with "chloro-.")  

### Step 3: The Ingredients  
Photosynthesis needs:  
1. **Light** (usually from the sun).  
2. **Carbon dioxide** (where does this come from?).  
3. **Water** (how do plants absorb it?).  
*What do you think these combine to make?*  

### Step 4: The Outputs  
- *What gas do plants release that animals need?*  
- *What sugary substance do plants make for energy?*  

**Try summarizing the process in your own words!**  

---  
**Key Takeaway:**  
Photosynthesis is how plants use sunlight to create food (glucose) from CO₂ and water, releasing oxygen.
